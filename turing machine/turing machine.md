Designing a Turing machine (TM) that accepts strings of 1's of length \(3^n\) requires implementing a process that counts and verifies whether the input string has exactly \(3^n\) 1's. Here is a detailed step-by-step approach to design this Turing machine:

### Components of the Turing Machine

- **Alphabet**: The input alphabet is \(\{1\}\), and the tape alphabet includes the input alphabet plus the blank symbol \(\{\#, 1\}\).
- **States**: The machine will have several states to handle counting, multiplying, and verifying the count.

### High-Level Steps

1. **Initialization**: Start by marking the first 1.
2. **Marking and Counting**: Replace each 1 with an X (a marker) and count the number of 1's.
3. **

Designing a Turing machine (TM) to accept strings of 1's of length \(3^n\) involves creating a machine that can count and verify that the length of the input string is exactly a power of 3. Below is a detailed description of the Turing machine and the steps it follows:

### Components of the Turing Machine

- **Input Alphabet**: \(\{1\}\)
- **Tape Alphabet**: \(\{1, X, \#\}\) (where X is a marker and \# is a blank symbol)
- **States**: We need a series of states to perform marking, counting, and verifying:
  - \(q_0\): Start state
  - \(q_1\): Mark and count state
  - \(q_2\): Check for completeness
  - \(q_3\): Multiply state
  - \(q_4\): Verify state
  - \(q_{accept}\): Accept state
  - \(q_{reject}\): Reject state

### High-Level Steps

1. **Initialization and Marking**:
   - Begin at the leftmost symbol of the input string.
   - Mark the first 1 as X and move to the next unmarked 1.
   - Repeat until all 1's are marked.

2. **Count the 1's and Verify if Length is 3**:
   - If exactly 3 1's are marked, move to the verification state.
   - If not, reject the input.

3. **Verify Power of 3**:
   - For each group of 3 marked 1's, replace them and continue the process.
   - If at any point the count is not a multiple of 3, reject the string.
   - If the input string is exhausted and correctly follows \(3^n\), accept the string.

### Detailed State Transitions

1. **Initialization and Marking**:

   **State \(q_0\)**:
   - Read 1, write X, move right, go to \(q_1\).
   - Read \#, go to \(q_{accept}\) if all symbols are marked.

   **State \(q_1\)**:
   - Read 1, move right.
   - Read X, move right.
   - Read \#, move to the counting step (count and verify if length is a multiple of 3).

2. **Counting and Verifying**:

   **State \(q_2\)**:
   - Read X, replace with 1, move right.
   - Count every third X, and check if it leads to an unmarked or end.
   - If not a multiple of 3, go to \(q_{reject}\).

3. **Verify Power of 3**:

   **State \(q_3\)**:
   - For each complete set of 3, move to the next unmarked.
   - Continue this process recursively until the end of the string.

4. **Acceptance and Rejection**:

   **State \(q_{accept}\)**:
   - Halt and accept if the string length is exactly \(3^n\).

   **State \(q_{reject}\)**:
   - Halt and reject otherwise.

### Example State Transitions

Here is a simplified state table for the TM:

| Current State | Read Symbol | Write Symbol | Move Direction | Next State |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| \(q_0\)       | 1           | X            | R              | \(q_1\)    |
| \(q_1\)       | 1           | 1            | R              | \(q_1\)    |
| \(q_1\)       | X           | X            | R              | \(q_1\)    |
| \(q_1\)       | \#          | \#           | L              | \(q_2\)    |
| \(q_2\)       | X           | 1            | R              | \(q_2\)    |
| \(q_2\)       | \#          | \#           | -              | \(q_3\)    |
| \(q_3\)       | ...         | ...          | ...            | ...        |

### Conclusion

This Turing machine design accepts strings of 1's whose length is a power of 3 by marking, counting, and verifying the input string in a structured manner. Each step ensures the length of the string meets the criteria of being \(3^n\).
