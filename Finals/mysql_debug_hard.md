### Sample Tables with Data

#### Products Table

```sql


| ProductID | ProductName | CategoryID | SupplierID | UnitPrice | UnitsInStock | Discontinued | DateAdded           |
| 1         | Product A   | 1          | 1          | 10.50     | 100          | 0            | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| 2         | Product B   | 2          | 2          | 15.75     | 50           | 1            | 2023-02-01 11:00:00 |
| 3         | Product C   | 1          | 3          | 25.00     | 0            | 0            | 2023-03-01 12:00:00 |

### Complex Query with Errors

```sql
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.UnitPrice, c.CategoryName, s.SupplierName, p.UnitsInStock, p.DateAdded, p.Discontinued
FROM Products p
JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryID == c.CategoryID
LEFT JOIN Suppliers s ON p.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
WHERE p.UnitPrice > 20 AND (p.UnitsInStock > 0 OR p.Discontinued == 1)
ORDER BY p.DateAdded DESC, p.UnitPrice ASC
LIMIT 10
UNION ALL
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, UnitPrice, CategoryName, SupplierName, UnitsInStock, DateAdded, Discontinued
FROM Products
WHERE UnitsInStock IS NULL OR UnitPrice < 5
GROUP BY ProductID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
;

SELECT AVG(UnitPrice), SUM(UnitsInStock), MIN(DateAdded), MAX(DateAdded)
FROM Products p
WHERE DateAdded > '2023-01-01'
;

UPDATE Products
SET UnitPrice = UnitPrice * 1.1
WHERE UnitsInStock < 50 AND Discontinued = 0
ORDER BY ProductName
;

DELETE FROM Products
WHERE Discontinued = 2
LIMIT 5
;
```

### Errors in the Query

1. **JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryID == c.CategoryID** (should be a single equals sign `=` instead of `==`)
2. **p.Discontinued == 1** (should be a single equals sign `=` instead of `==`)
3. **UNION ALL** used incorrectly (needs to be in a subquery or should match the column count of the first SELECT)
4. **SELECT ProductID, ProductName, UnitPrice, CategoryName, SupplierName, UnitsInStock, DateAdded, Discontinued** (missing table alias prefix in the second SELECT)
5. **GROUP BY ProductID** (GROUP BY is used incorrectly without an aggregate function)
6. **HAVING COUNT(*) > 1** (HAVING is used incorrectly in this context)
7. **SELECT AVG(UnitPrice), SUM(UnitsInStock), MIN(DateAdded), MAX(DateAdded) FROM Products p WHERE DateAdded > '2023-01-01'** (incorrect use of aggregate functions without GROUP BY)
8. **UPDATE Products SET UnitPrice = UnitPrice * 1.1 WHERE UnitsInStock < 50 AND Discontinued = 0 ORDER BY ProductName** (ORDER BY clause is not valid in an UPDATE statement)
9. **DELETE FROM Products WHERE Discontinued = 2 LIMIT 5** (Discontinued is a BIT field and should be either 0 or 1)
10. **p.UnitPrice > 20 AND (p.UnitsInStock > 0 OR p.Discontinued == 1)** (logical OR operator condition parentheses)
11. **FROM Products p JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryID == c.CategoryID LEFT JOIN Suppliers s ON p.SupplierID = s.SupplierID** (missing `ON` keyword before the second join condition)
12. **LIMIT 10** (LIMIT is misplaced in this context and not used correctly with UNION ALL)
13. **WHERE UnitsInStock IS NULL OR UnitPrice < 5 GROUP BY ProductID HAVING COUNT(*) > 1** (mixing WHERE and GROUP BY clauses improperly)
14. **UPDATE Products SET UnitPrice = UnitPrice * 1.1 WHERE UnitsInStock < 50 AND Discontinued = 0 ORDER BY ProductName** (logical AND condition without parentheses)
15. **DELETE FROM Products WHERE Discontinued = 2 LIMIT 5** (inappropriate use of LIMIT in DELETE without proper MySQL support)

By identifying these errors, students can enhance their debugging skills and improve their understanding of complex SQL query writing.
